# Amstelveen BasicFit Schedule

## Why?
There is a paper schedule at the gym, I bring it home but I always miss it when I need it. So I decided to make a simple web app to show the schedule.

I created this page to be able to check it whenever I want, and to be able to check it on my phone.

## How?
I used tailwind and Alpinejs to create this page. Everything is simple and in `index.html`.

## Fix the schedule?
Just create a pull request or send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mghodsizadeh).

## Donate
Really? I created it in less than 1 hour. But if you insist, you can buy me a coffee(or A protein shake from the gym vending machine :D)!
